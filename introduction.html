            <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
            <p>
                &emsp;Health insurance is a financial arrangement that provides individuals and families with coverage for medical expenses, helping to reduce the burden of high healthcare costs. It plays a crucial role in ensuring access to essential healthcare services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, prescription medications, preventive care, and specialized treatments
                 <br> <br>
            
                &emsp;Health insurance can be obtained through various sources, such as employer- sponsored plans, private insurers, and government programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace. The availability, affordability, and quality of coverage depend on factors such as income level, employment status, geographic location, and government regulations.<br> <br>
                
                &emsp;Despite its benefits, challenges persist, including high premiums, deductibles claim denials, and disparities in access to care. Many individuals remain
                uninsured or underinsured due to cost concerns or lack of awareness about available options. As healthcare systems evolve, reforms and innovations continue to shape the health insurance landscape, aiming to make coverage
                more accessible and effective
